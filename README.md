### <a id="1."> **arXiv 2023** PrefixMol: Target- and Chemistry-aware Molecule Design via Prefix Embedding</a>  

**Motivation**:
Target-aware generative models have generated considerable attention in AI-assisted drug discovery. As pharmaceutical molecules are only effective when they bind to target proteins, creating molecules with a high affinity to the target is crucial. **However, they impose no constraints on the chemistry of the generated molecules and are, therefore, unable to control their chemical properties.**
Is there a unified model for generating molecules considering different conditions, such as binding pockets and chemical properties? Although targetaware generative models have made significant advances in drug design, they do not consider chemistry conditions and cannot guarantee the desired chemical properties. Unfortunately, merging the target-aware and chemical-aware models into a unified model to meet customized requirements may lead to the problem of negative transfer.

**Contibution**:
Inspired by the success of multi-task learning in the NLP area, we use prefix embeddings to provide a novel generative model that considers both the targeted pocketâ€™s circumstances and a variety of chemical properties. All conditional information is represented as learnable features, which the generative model subsequently employs as a contextual prompt. 

**Results**:
Experiments show that our model exhibits good controllability in both single and multi-conditional molecular generation. The controllability enables us to outperform previous structure-based drug design methods. More interestingly, we open up the attention mechanism and reveal coupling relationships between conditions, providing guidance for multi-conditional molecule generation.
